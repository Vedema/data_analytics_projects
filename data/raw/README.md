# Raw Data

This directory contains the original, immutable datasets used in the course projects.

## Guidelines

- Never modify files in this directory
- Keep original data formats
- Document the source of each dataset
- Large files should be stored externally (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox) and linked in project documentation
