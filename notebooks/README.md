# Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and exploration.

## Guidelines

- Use descriptive names for notebooks (e.g., `01_data_exploration.ipynb`, `02_statistical_analysis.ipynb`)
- Include clear markdown cells explaining your analysis
- Number notebooks in the order they should be run
- Keep notebooks focused on specific tasks

## Template Structure

Each analysis notebook should include:
1. **Introduction**: Describe the objective and dataset
2. **Data Loading**: Import and initial inspection
3. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, etc.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizations and statistics
5. **Analysis/Modeling**: Main analytical work
6. **Conclusions**: Key findings and insights
